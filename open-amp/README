OpenAMP Zephyr Module Support
#############################

Standalone Zephyr Module support for upstream open-amp
   https://github.com/OpenAMP/open-amp

This branch carries the zephyr module support to use 
upstream open-amp with zephyr.

It assumes that the real open-amp has been cloned as a peer to this directory
with the name open-amp.
